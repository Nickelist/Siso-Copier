# Privacy Policy for Siso Copier

**Last Updated:** January 1, 2026

**Siso Copier** ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy fully discloses how we collect, use, store, and share your data when you use our Chrome Extension.

## 1. Information We Collect

We have designed **Siso Copier** with a "Local-First" infrastructure. We **do not** collect, harvest, sell, or transmit your personal data to our own servers.

### A. User-Generated Content (Stored Locally)

We process the following data, which is generated by your direct interactions with the extension:

- **Highlighted Text**: Keywords and phrases you select on web pages.
- **Extracted Content**: Text you explicitly select for summarization or explanation.
- **Browsing History (Local Context)**: The extension saves the URL and Title of pages _only_ where you have actively created highlights, to allow you to return to them later.

### B. User Preferences (Sync Storage)

We store your configuration settings to provide a consistent experience across devices:

- Theme preferences
- Highlighting color palettes
- Keyboard shortcuts
- UI toggle states

## 2. How We Use Your Information

The information we process is used strictly to provide the extension's core functionality:

1. **Highlighting**: To persist your highlights on specific pages so they remain visible when you revisit them.
2. **History Dashboard**: To verify and display a list of your past research and highlights within the extension's sidebar.
3. **AI Features**: To process text content (summaries, explanations, rewrites, quizzes) upon your explicit request.

## 3. Data Storage

### A. Local Storage (`chrome.storage.local`)

All "User-Generated Content" (highlights, page context, history logs) is stored **locally on your device**. This data never leaves your browser unless you explicitly export it or send it to an AI provider (see Section 4).

### B. Sync Storage (`chrome.storage.sync`)

"User Preferences" are stored in your Chrome Sync account. This data is managed directly by Google's infrastructure and is encrypted according to your Google account settings.

## 4. Data Sharing and AI Features

**Siso Copier** integrates with Third-Party Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide "Summarize", "Explain", "Rewrite", "Quiz", and "Key Insights" features.

- **User-Initiated Only**: Data is _only_ shared when you click a specific button (e.g., "Summarize Page", "Quiz Me", or "Rewrite").
- **Direct Transmission**: The extension sends data directly from your browser to the AI Provider's API. It does **not** pass through any intermediate server owned by us.
- **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**: You provide your own API keys. We do not provide or resell access to these services.
- **Local Models**: If you use local providers (e.g., LM Studio, Chrome AI), your data remains entirely on your device and is not transmitted to any cloud provider.

**Third-Party Providers:**
If you choose to use cloud-based features, your data will be subject to the privacy policies of the respective providers you select:

- **Google Gemini**: [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- **OpenAI**: [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy)
- **Anthropic / OpenRouter**: [OpenRouter Privacy Policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy)
- **Fal.ai**: [Fal.ai Privacy Policy](https://fal.ai/privacy)

Siso Copier - AI Research Assistant & Highlighter

## Short Description

Streamline your web research with Siso Copier, the all-in-one sidebar tool that lets you highlight text, auto-copy with context, and summarize web content using AI.

## Detailed Description

Siso Copier transforms your browser into a powerful research station, allowing you to highlight text, extract content, and leverage AI insights all from a sleek, non-intrusive sidebar. Designed for students, researchers, and professionals, it streamlines the way you gather information by instantly marking keywords across any webpage and automatically capturing the source URL and page title with every clip. The smart extraction feature allows you to copy page content free of ads and clutter, ensuring you get only the clean text you need.

For more in-depth analysis, Siso Copier includes a built-in **AI Explainer** tab capable of summarizing long articles in seconds or explaining complex text selections. It supports multiple providers including Google Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, and local models via a clean, tabbed interface that keeps your research organized. You can also switch to a distraction-free Reader Mode that converts cluttered pages into a clean, readable format complete with images and dark mode support.

All your research is saved locally in a persistent history, ensuring you never lose a finding. You can organize your clips and export everything to Markdown for seamless integration with notes apps like Obsidian, Notion, or GitHub. Your privacy is paramount; Siso Copier stores your API keys locally on your device and never transmits your data to external servers, making it the perfect tool for building your secure personal knowledge base.

## Future Roadmap & Enhancements

1.  **"Chat with Page" Interface**: Upgrade the AI tab to a conversational interface. Ask specific questions like "What are the pros and cons listed?" or "Find all dates mentioned" instead of just static summaries.
2.  **Smart Copy Presets**: Instead of complex code, provide a simple dropdown menu to instantly format clips for your favorite tools.
    - _Options_: "Obsidian (Markdown)", "Notion Table", "Email Friendly", "Tweet Thread".
    - _Benefit_: One-click formatting without needing to learn any syntax.
3.  **Visual Content Picker**: Simplify the complex "Content Filtering" settings. instead of typing technical selectors, simply click on the parts of the page you want to ignore (like ads or menus) to block them permanently.
4.  **Auto-Highlight Watchlist**: A passive scanning feature where users define a list of "watched keywords" (e.g., "Revenue", "Competitor Name").
    - _Function_: Whenever you visit ANY page, these keywords are automatically highlighted in a specific color.
    - _Benefit_: Never miss important terms while skimming new content.
5.  **Project Collections**: Move beyond a flat history. Allow users to create "Projects" (e.g., "Thesis", "Vacation") and save clips directly into them.

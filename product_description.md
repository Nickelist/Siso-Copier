# Detailed Description

Siso Copier transforms your browser into a powerful research station, allowing you to highlight text, extract content, and leverage AI insights all from a sleek, non-intrusive sidebar. Designed for students, researchers, and professionals, it streamlines the way you gather information by instantly marking keywords across any webpage and automatically capturing the source URL and page title with every clip. The smart extraction feature allows you to copy page content free of ads and clutter, ensuring you get only the clean text you need.

For more in-depth analysis, Siso Copier includes a built-in AI assistant capable of summarizing long articles in seconds or explaining complex text selections. It supports multiple providers including Google Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, and local models, giving you flexibility in how you process information. You can also switch to a distraction-free Reader Mode that converts cluttered pages into a clean, readable format complete with images and dark mode support.

All your research is saved locally in a persistent history, ensuring you never lose a finding. You can organize your clips and export everything to Markdown for seamless integration with notes apps like Obsidian, Notion, or GitHub. Your privacy is paramount; Siso Copier stores your API keys locally on your device and never transmits your data to external servers, making it the perfect tool for building your secure personal knowledge base.
